# Predicting Purchases, Ratings, and Categories Based on Amazon Reviews**

This repsoitory contains the codes used for each prediction task. <br />
For the rating prediction task, we implemented a latent factor model with regularization. <br />
For the purchase prediction task, we used a decision tree combined with similarity index using a Jaccard index. <br />
For the category prediction, we used a convolutional neural network as well as a logistic regression with count vectorization. <br />
